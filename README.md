# The_Arcane_Trials
Grade 12 Computer Science Major Assignment

Created in Unity, this game is a 3-D platforming shooter using ray casting. 

This game was entered into the Sheridan Game Making competition in 2017, where my team and I were asked to present our product in front of a panel of judges.
Our game won the competition!
